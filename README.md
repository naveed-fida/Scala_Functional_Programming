### Exercises - Functional Programming in Scala

I'm currently reading the _Functional Programming in Scala_ book from Manning. This repo contains solutions to exercises from that book. I've only just begun reading it so I'll be adding more exercises as I go along. The book has its own repo but these are my own solutions which in some cases are different from the ones in that repo.
